Welcome to the GitHub project for an Amazon clone created using HTML and CSS only! In this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing and functional website that emulates the look and feel of Amazon's website.


I used HTML and CSS to build the website from scratch. We utilized various CSS techniques to create a fluid and dynamic layout, including Flexbox and Grid.

The website features a navigation bar that allows users to browse through different categories and search for products. The product pages display product details, including images, descriptions, and pricing.

In addition to the basic functionality, I added some extra features to enhance the user experience. For example, we incorporated a dropdown menu for the shopping cart that displays the items. I also added hover effects to the product images and buttons to make the website more interactive.

Overall, this project is a great example of what can be achieved with HTML and CSS only. I hope that it serves as a useful resource for those looking to learn web development or improve their skills.
